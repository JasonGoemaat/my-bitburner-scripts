# my-bitburner-scripts

This is a repo I created for my personal bitburner scripts.
To load into bitburner, 

1. run `nano pull.js` 
2. paste the contents of [`pull.js`]
3. run `run pull.js`

Alternatively, fetch the `pull.js` using this terminal command in bitburner:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonGoemaat/my-bitburner-scripts/main/pull.js pull.js`
